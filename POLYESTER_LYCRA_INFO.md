## Combined Page Recommendation

Since both polyester and lycra are:
- Fabric-based (not silicone/latex)
- Similar price range (€2.10-€3.79)
- Same target market (recreational, schools, merchandising)
- Same features (comfortable, lightweight, hypoallergenic)

**Recommendation:** Create a single "Gorros de Tela" (Fabric Caps) page covering both polyester and lycra, or separate pages if user prefers detailed distinction.
